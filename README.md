# Who Am I?

Githubber and empathetic engineer. HugOps, Documentation, Readability, Heavy Metal, Powerlifting, and
Veganism has been my tagline for a while. It both encompasses a lot about me and does little to describe me.

## Personal Projects

I create a lot of projects I won't finish. I also host a lot of my own infrastructure. You can see my
infrastruture in the [Frodux Organization on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Frodux).

For most other personal projects that have been touched recently, they're under [my username (tebriel) on
Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tebriel)
